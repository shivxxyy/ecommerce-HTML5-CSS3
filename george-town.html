        <div class="g8teen-about">Right next to the G-9 Teen store, this store is (obviously) a sister concern.<br> While the kind of stuff you'll find here is quite similar (casual, colourful,<br> cool prints), they also have a good amount of basic, solid-coloured and<br> patterned shirts you could check out. All the stuff here too is menswear,<br> but women who like to shop in the men's section (all of us!) will find<br> some cool stuff here.

            <div class="indifusion-about">This store is quite huge and they make apparel from natural fabrics<br> such as cotton, silk, and linen only. From dresses and tunics to saris<br> and heavier suits, they do everything. Their collection is priced a bit<br> higher than the other options in George Town, but considering it's a<br> slow fashion brand, we feel it's worth it.

                <div class="fashiongarage-about">We have no idea why we didn't discover this store earlier, because this is a<br> clear winner for us. From Pink Floyd tour merch, to Star Wars t-shirts, to<br> even really funny fridge magnets and patches, this store is literally heaven<br> for anyone who loves pop-culture. They've got apparel for both men and<br> women, and most of their stuff is kind of neutral. They've even got a lot of<br> reasonably priced denims.
